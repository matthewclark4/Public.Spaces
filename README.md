Documentation of Public.Spaces App

Public.Spaces is an app that explores how digital tools can make privatised spaces public. It is intended to subvert, disrupt and democratise the privatisation of public space in London.

The app uses AR to allow the user to draw in 3D spaces. They can then save and load their sketches to their location.
