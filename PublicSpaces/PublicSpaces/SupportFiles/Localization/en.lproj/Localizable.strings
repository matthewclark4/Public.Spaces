It is intended to subvert, disrupt and democratise the privatisation of public space in London.\n\nThere are now well over 50 pseudo public spaces in London, not only are these spaces discriminative but they are also not subject to ordinary local authority bylaws. This creates an entirely exclusionary zone.\n\nUsers are invited to add a new layer on-top of these zones which asks people to explore what makes these spaces so exclusive and question what is the value of public space?
